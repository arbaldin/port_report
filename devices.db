# A list of devices that we need to consult
# This script uses netmiko library
#
# Lines started with '#' are comments
#
# For each device you should inform all fields. Example:
# hostname,device_type,host,global_delay_factor,timeout,vendor,site,service
# SWITCH01,cisco_ios,10.0.0.1,1,CISCO,DC1,ACCESS
#
# Valid device_type are: cisco_ios, dell_os9, extreme_nos, juniper_junos, 
# extreme_netiron, cisco_ios_telnet, dell_os6, ruckus_fastiron, cisco_nxos.
# Althoug netmiko supports other NOS, those were the devices I worked with and
# made the proper parsing.
